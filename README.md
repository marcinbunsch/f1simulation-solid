## SolidJS F1 Simulator

This is a little fun project which mixes a few things I wanted to try:

- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- Building a game loop and rendering it in Solid
- Simulating an F1 race

My inspiration was Motorsport Manager 3, one of my favorite games. I wanted to see if I could build a similar game in - I focused on the race part. It meant I needed to have a game loop, rendering, physics simulation, and even a little AI (for pit stops).

You can see it in action here: https://bunsch.pl/f1simulation/.

### How to run

```bash
$ pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```

Afterwards

```bash
$ pnpm dev # or npm run dev or yarn dev
```
